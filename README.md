# SQL_challenge
In this challenge, I used pgAdmin, QuickDBD, and PostgreSQL to conduct Data modeling, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis on several csv files that contain mock employee information data. I started by creating ERD diagram of all my tables using the QuickDBD website (https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com/), establishing primary and foreign keys, and establishing data types. Then, I created a schema containing all the tables in my SQL database and imported the csv file to each respective table. Finally, I used the newly created tables to run queries and answer question regarding the data.
